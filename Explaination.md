### Here is an example of how the x array is created for a sample in the BERTDataset class:

Suppose we have the following data for a user:
- content_ids: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- answered_correctly: [0, 1, 1, 0, 1]

This data represents a sequence of 5 content IDs and the corresponding answered correctly values for each content ID. To create the x array for this sample, we would first shift the content IDs and answered correctly values by one:
- content_ids: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
- answered_correctly: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]

Next, we would add the answered correctly values to the content IDs to get the x array: x: [0, 1, 3, 4, 4]

In this example, x is an array of length 5, with the first element being 0, the second element being 1, the third element being 3, the fourth element being 4, and the fifth element being 4. This array represents the input data for the BERT model for this sample. The BERT model will take this array as input and produce an output that is used to calculate the model's loss and accuracy.


### why do we need to shift the content IDs and answered correctly values by one?
The content IDs and answered correctly values are shifted by one because the BERT model is trained to predict the next content ID and answered correctly value in a sequence given the previous content IDs and answered correctly values in the sequence. Shifting the content IDs and answered correctly values by one ensures that the model is trained to predict the next item in the sequence, rather than simply memorizing the input data.

For example, suppose the model is given the input x array from the previous example and is asked to predict the next content ID and answered correctly value in the sequence. The model would use the input x array to produce an output, and this output would be compared to the true next content ID and answered correctly value in the sequence (i.e., the shifted content IDs and answered correctly values) to calculate the model's loss and accuracy. This allows the model to learn to make predictions based on the input data, rather than simply memorizing the input data.
